          Hi, I'm Hunter.
        </h2>
        <p class="text-[#4e3d34] leading-7 text-lg mt-4">
          When I was about 15, my dad found me in the garage using his Dremel tool to burn designs into scrap wood. Instead of getting mad, he got me my first real wood burner, and since then, it’s become a gateway art project to the state of my current life (multiple art projects from painting, flower pressing, you name it, around the house constantly).
        </p>
        <p class="text-[#4e3d34] leading-7 text-lg mt-4">
          I’ve lived in Utah for most of my life, and even as an adult, I’m still just a kid who likes to play outside. Most of what I create is inspired by Utah’s mountains, deserts, and wild spaces.
        </p>
        <p class="text-[#4e3d34] leading-7 text-lg mt-4">
          Anyways, I hope you enjoy my work as much as I enjoy making it!
